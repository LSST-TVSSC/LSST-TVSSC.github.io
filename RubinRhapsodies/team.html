										<p>
											Jendaya  Wells is a rising junior at Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, an HBCU with a proud history. She is a Music/Vocal Performance major and Business Management minor. After graduation, she plans to pursue a career in music production. Jendaya was presented with this opportunity to work with Dr. Federica Bianco and Riley Clarke along with her Professor, Dr. Christine Limb, on Sonification of LSST data which has been enlightening. She was able to code in different formats and explain terms of music with those she worked with on the sonification. She hopes to carry this knowledge with her in her academic and ultimately her professional career.  Jendaya  Wells has been supported in this project by the “Leveling the playing field” Heising Simons Foundation 2021-2022 grant to the Science Collaborations administered by Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and by an LSST Corporation Enabling Science Grant.

										<h2>Riley Clarke</h2>
										<p>
											Riley received a B.S. in Physics from Western Washington University and M.S. in Physics from the University of Delaware, where he is working on completing his Ph.D under supervision of Dr. Federica Bianco studying rapid brightening of stars called "flares". He is a member of the <a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">Rubin LSST Transients and Variable Stars Science Collaboration</a> and works on enabling the study of stellar flares in the LSST Wide Fast Deep survey by taking advantage of atmospheric refraction. From a family of professional musicians, Riley enjoys playing guitar and trumpet recreationally, and formerly competed in Solo-Ensemble contests in his home state of Alaska. Mr. Clarke is partially supported in his sonification research by NSF Award  #2308016 "Every Datapoint Counts: Atmosphere-aided Flare Studies in the Rubin Era (PI Bianco)"

										<p>
											Feranmi Adepoju is a Nigerian Junior at Lincoln University. Feranmi is pursuing his passion for knowledge by double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. He is a member of the Lincoln Concert Choir. After graduation, he plans to go into the field of UX/UI (User Experience/User Interface) designs. Feranmi has been working alongside Prof. Limb on understanding the musical aspects of sonificatoin and Mr. Clarke and Dr. Bianco on understanding the astrophysical data and coding environmental aspects of the observations, such as the moon phase, mapped to a drone. Feranmi has been supported in his work on this project by NSF HDR Data Science Corps Award #2123264 "Delaware And Mid Atlantic Data Science Corps" (PI Bianco)

										<h2>Dr. Christine Limb</h2>
										<p>
										Dr. Christine Limb is an Associate Professor of Music at the Lincoln University of Pennsylvania
                                            (LU) where she teaches music theory, history, and French horn. Dr. Limb earned her Doctor of
                                            Musical Arts Degree from the University of Southern California where she studied the French
                                            horn with the late Vincent DeRosa. Her 25+ years of teaching in higher education has focused
                                            on the analysis of music and melding analysis, especially musical form, into all aspects of
                                            teaching and understanding music.
                                            Christine’s current research focuses on music combined with other disciplines. This includes a
                                            recent National Science Foundation Award conferred to a team of professors from three
                                            universities including Lincoln University, a Critical Thinking Grant awarded by UCLA and
                                            Pepperdine University and a Mellon Grant for the Arts with a project focused jointly on music
                                            and biology.
                                            Christine is a lifetime member of the International Horn Society and the University of Southern
                                            California Thornton School of Music Alumni Association. She loves cats and dogs, especially her
                                            cat “Claudia.”
